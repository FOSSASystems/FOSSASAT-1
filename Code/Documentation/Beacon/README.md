Beacon software system design
============================

### Overview
- The "system design.docx" defines the exact features required in the arduino sketch running on the beacon's ATMEGA chip along with the detailed formats.

- The "Task List.docx" defines some generic tasks which are to be included in the program itself.

- The task list should not be used as a checklist, it is a simple reference to ensure some of the hidden, complicated features are completed.


### Issues
- Pin layouts or I2C?
